You&#8221;re welcome, America.\n<\/p><h4>If Bach Wrote&#8230; Oops!&#8230; I Did It Again<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/jdauriemma.com\/audio\/mp3\/002IfBachWroteOopsIDidItAgain.mp3\">If Bach Wrote&#8230; Oops!&#8230; I Did It Again<\/a>\n<\/p><h4>Triumphant Return<\/h4>\n<p>I apologize for my long hiatus on new posts - lots of new and exciting things are happening in my personal life right now and I&#8217;ve had to put writing on the back burner for a bit. But enough about me. <a href=\"http:\/\/jdauriemma.com\/blog\/tag\/if-bach-wrote\/\">If Bach Wrote&#8230;<\/a> (IBW) is a personal project of mine where I regularly pick an iconic tune from pop culture, extract melodic material from it, and compose a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fugue\">fugue<\/a> with that melody as the <a href=\"http:\/\/jan.ucc.nau.edu\/tas3\/fugueanatomy.html\">subject<\/a>.<\/p><p>So far I&#8217;ve tackled <a href=\"http:\/\/jdauriemma.com\/blog\/if-bach-wrote-dont-stop-believin\">Journey<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/jdauriemma.com\/blog\/if-bach-wrote-turn-down-for-what\/\">Lil Jon<\/a>, and I&#8217;ve been pretty surprised with the large audience both pieces have acquired (relative to what I&#8221;m used to). If you&#8217;ve listened to those two pieces, thank you! Who knew that <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Polyphony\">polyphony<\/a> could still be popular in the 21st century?<\/p>\n<h4>The Original<\/h4>\n<p>For you music readers: <a href=\"#score\">view the score<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Bubblegum pop is often given the cold shoulder by musicologists, but the refrain of &#8220;Oops!&#8230; I Did It Again&#8221; makes for a fascinating fugue subject. <a href=\"http:\/\/grooveshark.com\/#!\/s\/Oops+I+Did+It+Again\/2M1Qyi?src=5\">Listen here<\/a> - you can skip to 0:50 to hear the refrain, but you&#8221;d be missing out on some slick bass playing by Thomas Lindberg. <\/p>\n<h4>Analysis<\/h4>\n<p>This piece is a rare five-voice fugue, meaning there are up to five independent melodies happening in parallel. Most composers hesitate to write five-voice fugues (Bach only has a handful to his name): they tend to border on a &#8220;chorale&#8221; like sound, which can sound overly &#8220;vertical&#8221; and suffer from a lack of true polyphony. On top of that, most fugue subject are either too busy or have to wide of a tonal range to accommodate for five voices. &#8220;Oops!&#8230; I Did It Again&#8221; is slow enough (I slowed it down to 60bpm) and compact enough (within a sixth) that I decided to throw caution to the wind and give five voices a shot.

This obviously presents a challenge: holding an audience whilst writing about a wide variety of mostly unrelated subjects. I love listening to and composing music, so my first thought was to regularly write music reviews and occasionally post an original composition whenever I feel like writing one. Both of those options now seem really uninteresting and offer nothing new in terms of interesting content.<\/p>\n<p>The question lingered: how do I blog about music in a way that&#8221;s potentially interesting to myself and my intended audience (the internet)? The answer is around 300 years old. I am a huge Bach fan. Not only do I like listening to his music, I also enjoy composing polyphonic music that imitates Bach&#8221;s style. I have composed more than a handful of fugues (<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fugue\">what&#8221;s a fugue?<\/a>) in my life and some of them have turned out halfway decent. These fugues are also completely uninteresting to everyone else except music theory nerds.<\/p>\n<p>But lots of people like rap and pop music, so what if I could marry my interest in composing in a centuries-old idiom without boring everyone to death? Ladies and gentlemen, I give you&#8230;<\/p>\n<h4>If Bach Wrote&#8230;<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/jdauriemma.com\/audio\/mp3\/000IfBachWroteTurnDownforWhat.mp3\"><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.flaticon.com\/png\/256\/375.png\"\/><br\/>If Bach Wrote &#8220;Turn Down for What&#8221;<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.noteflight.com\/scores\/view\/52c241c3b178ed536a2ca961994176a5f0536125\"><br\/>View the full score here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>This series will be a semi-regular (monthly maybe?) series in which I take a given Top 40 Song, extract melodies from that song, and compose a fugue based on that melody.
