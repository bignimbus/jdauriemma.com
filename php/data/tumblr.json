This obviously presents a challenge: holding an audience whilst writing about a wide variety of mostly unrelated subjects. I love listening to and composing music, so my first thought was to regularly write music reviews and occasionally post an original composition whenever I feel like writing one. Both of those options now seem really uninteresting and offer nothing new in terms of interesting content.<\/p>\n<p>The question lingered: how do I blog about music in a way that&#8221;s potentially interesting to myself and my intended audience (the internet)? The answer is around 300 years old. I am a huge Bach fan. Not only do I like listening to his music, I also enjoy composing polyphonic music that imitates Bach&#8221;s style. I have composed more than a handful of fugues (<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fugue\">what&#8221;s a fugue?<\/a>) in my life and some of them have turned out halfway decent. These fugues are also completely uninteresting to everyone else except music theory nerds.<\/p>\n<p>But lots of people like rap and pop music, so what if I could marry my interest in composing in a centuries-old idiom without boring everyone to death? Ladies and gentlemen, I give you&#8230;<\/p>\n<h4>If Bach Wrote&#8230;<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/jdauriemma.com\/audio\/mp3\/000IfBachWroteTurnDownforWhat.mp3\"><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.flaticon.com\/png\/256\/375.png\"\/><br\/>If Bach Wrote &#8220;Turn Down for What&#8221;<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.noteflight.com\/scores\/view\/52c241c3b178ed536a2ca961994176a5f0536125\"><br\/>View the full score here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>This series will be a semi-regular (monthly maybe?) series in which I take a given Top 40 Song, extract melodies from that song, and compose a fugue based on that melody. The title will always be: &#8220;If Bach Wrote&#8230; [Song Title].&#8221; Without further ado:<\/p>\n<h3>If Bach Wrote &#8220;Turn Down for What&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p>Lil Jon and DJ Snake released &#8220;Turn Down for What&#8221; in late 2013 and has since gone platinum and hit #1 on two US Billboard charts. It also has a synthesizer ostinato that is absolutely entrancing:<\/p>\n<p><em>Audio Clip: Lil Jon \/ DJ Snake &#8220;Turn Down for What&#8221; (original)<\/em><\/p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"http:\/\/jdauriemma.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/turndownclip.mp3\">Synth Line<\/a><\/li><\/ul><p>This synth ostinato will serve as the fugue&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/jan.ucc.nau.edu\/tas3\/fugueanatomy.html\">subject<\/a>.
